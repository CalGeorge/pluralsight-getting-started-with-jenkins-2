# Getting Started with Jenkins 2

This repository contains all resources I created during the Pluralsight course "Getting Started with Jenkins 2"

## Contents

This project uses Docker Compose to create a Jenkins container with a named volume.

A custom Dockerfile is used to add Maven to the Jenkins container.

## Usage

To start the container and volume run the following command within the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
